*Name: broker_update.c
*Purpose: Modify the broker.c program of section 5.2 by making both of the following
		  changes:
		  (a) Ask the user to enter the number of shares and the price per share,
		  	  instead of the value of the trade
		  (b) Add statements that compute the commission charged by a rival broker
		  	  ($33 plus 3 cent per share for fewer than 2000 shares, $33 plus 2 cent
		  	  per share for 2000 shares or more)
		  	  Display the rival's commission as well as the commission charged
		  	  by the original broker
